##  1) House Price Prediction : Machine Learning model to predict house price using linear regression


![house price prediction (ML)- Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/pavankalyanchittala/House-Price-Prediction/assets/117903644/17582a9c-cd78-4802-80cd-a28b3c921025)





The dataset, I taken from Kaggle contains the housing prices dataset that for this project. This dataset likely includes various features such as the size of the house, number of rooms, location, and other relevant information. By utilizing linear regression, you can train a machine learning model on this dataset to predict house prices based on these features.

To get started, you can download the dataset from the provided link and explore its contents. Make sure to preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables if any, and splitting it into training and testing sets. Then, you can train a linear regression model using the training data and evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics.

Remember to perform feature selection or engineering if necessary to improve the model's accuracy. Once the model is trained and evaluated, you can use it to predict house prices for new, unseen data.
